# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple application(https://week-05-homework.herokuapp.com/) demonstrating data persistence by giving the user
the option of filling in times during today with tasks, visually showing the current hour, past hours, and future hours.

The user can save the tasks, and they should persist between sessions.

## Technologies

Front-end: jQuery, Moment.js, Javascript, Bootstrap 4

Middleware: Node.js with express and Apollo Server/GraphQL

Data Persistence: MongoDB

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule 
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner 
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule 
WHEN I open the planner 
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar 
WHEN I scroll down T
HEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours 
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day 
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock 
THEN I can enter an event 
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock 
THEN the text for that event is saved in persistent storage 
WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
```

The following demonstrates the application screenshot:
